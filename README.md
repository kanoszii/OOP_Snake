# About:
This is my first object-oriented project written in Python.  
Designed as an attempt to recreate the popular game Snake.   

__REQUIRED:__  
You should update the path for saving the best score.  
To accomplish this, navigate to the scoreboard.py file and modify lines 11 and 35 (they are commented).  

_OPTIONAL:_  
_You can adjust the path to the sound that is played when the snake "eats.", I attached it with the rest of files in this project._  
_(if you don't need it just comment lines 7-11)_  


## Controls:
* W - Up
* A - left
* S - Down
* D - right  

## How to start the game:  
To begin the game, you should execute the "main.py" file.
