## ABOUT THE PROJECT:
This is my first object-oriented project written in Python.  
Designed as an attempt to recreate the popular game Snake.   

OPTIONAL:  
You can adjust the path to the sound that is played when the snake "eats."  
(if you don't need it just comment lines 7-11)  
To start the game, you should run the "Main"
## CONTROLS
* W - Up
