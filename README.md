## ABOUT THE PROJECT:
This is my first object-oriented project designed as an attempt to recreate the popular game Snake. To start the game, you should run the "Main" file and also adjust the path to the sound that is played when the snake "eats."
## CONTROLS
* W - Up
* A - left
* S - Down
* D - right
